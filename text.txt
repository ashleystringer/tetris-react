Board
    - Create a Canvas representation of a ROWS * COLS Board
    - Create an array to represent the Board
        - Either consisting of colors
        - or consisting of binary representations of blocks on the board
    - Prevent a piece from going out of bounds using collision detection
        - Prevent the processes of "moving" a piece if at least one "bit" is found
        - to be colliding with either side or the bottom
    - Once a piece hits the bottom
        - Make the location it's fallen in that color on the board canvas
        - Create a new piece
    - If a piece reaches the top of board canvas
        - Signal a game over
    - If the bottom row is filled, remove and replace it with the row above
    - Repeat the drop cycle for the piece
Piece
    - Create a new piece
    - Randomize the piece being created
    - Draw a piece onto the Board canvas iterating through each "bit"
    - Undraw a piece
    - Create an X and Y for a piece that corresponds to directions on the Board
    - Simulate moving down, left, and right with these
        - Undraw, (X or Y), draw
